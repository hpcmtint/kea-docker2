# Docker files for building Kea containers

This is a repository that one day hopes to rise to the rank of being an official
ISC Kea Docker repository. There is a long way ahead before this could happen.
Use with caution!

Those Docker files and images are based on Alpine 3.15.

You probably want to mount the following volumes:



Strictly speaking, you don't need to mount any of them. If you don't, Kea will
run on the defaults provided, but those will almost never work for you. At the
very least, you should mount `/etc/kea` with your own config file that
corresponds to your actual network.

# Building image

You need to have Docker installed. The image can be built using the following
command:

```shell
docker build - < docker/kea-dhcp4.Dockerfile
```

If user wants to install specific Kea version, not the onde defined
in dockerfile build argument `VERSION` is required

```shell
docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.3.8-r20230530063557 - < docker/kea-dhcp4.Dockerfile
```

If a user has access to premium packages, it should be added during the build process:

```shell
docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.3.8-r20230530063557 --build-arg TOKEN=<TOKEN> - < docker/kea-dhcp4.Dockerfile
```

If provided token grants access to subcribers or enterprise packages it should be specified:

```shell
docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.3.8-r20230530063557 --build-arg TOKEN=<TOKEN> --build-arg PREMIUM=ENTERPRISE - < docker/kea-dhcp4.Dockerfile
```


This will end up with something like the following:

```shell
Successfully built <image-id>
```

# Running the image

At the very least, you should tweak the following:

- add a configuration (subnets and options, probably also shared networks,
  classes and much more) to `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf`.
- configure TLS
- possibly configure leases, host, and/or config backends to point to specific databases
- IP address on which Control Agent will listen to the traffic

Using supervisor it's possible to start dhcp and control agent in the same container:

```shell
sudo docker run --volume=./config/kea:/etc/kea  \
                --volume=./:/var/lib/kea  \
                --volume=./supervisord.conf:/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf \
                --volume=./config/supervisor/kea-dhcp4.conf:/etc/supervisor/conf.d/kea-dhcp4.conf \
                --volume=./config/supervisor/kea-agent.conf:/etc/supervisor/conf.d/kea-agent.conf \
                -p host_ip:host_port:container_port <image-id>
```
